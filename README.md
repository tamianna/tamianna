### Hi, I'm Tamianna Hernandez - aka Tami! <img src="./images/Hi.gif" height="32" />

(Quite a few people don't know how to pronounce my full name, so it is easier to go by Tami!)
I have 7 years of customer service experience!
I have worked for Walmart, in dentistry, and Bentonville Public Schools since I started working in high school! Along the way, I have also acquired my CDL Class B!
I believe myself to be a quick learner, and once I get going with a new skill... I am very efficient! I am a hard worker and like to stay busy!

As someone who grew up being artistic and loving art, I have a keen eye for details. I like to make sure everything is how it should be or as "perfect" as it can be!âœ¨

## A passionate up and coming Developer!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **becoming a Software Engineer!**

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **all the languages involded with software engineering, from a 10 month bootcamp!**

- âš¡ Fun fact **I come from a family of nine!**
